# WW1 Trenches: A Top-Down Shooter

A top-down shooting game built with Pygame, set in the trenches and No Man's Land of World War 1. Play as a US soldier fighting your way across the battlefield to capture the enemy flag.

## Features

* Top-down perspective gameplay.

* WASD movement and mouse aiming/shooting.

* Bullet trails.

* Multiple enemy types with basic AI (including conceptual pathfinding).

* Obstacles for cover.

* Health and lives system with player respawning.

* Game Over and Victory states.

* Multiple levels with different layouts.

* Basic tilemap background.

* Sound effects and background music (requires asset files).

* Simple main menu.

## How to Play

1. **Run the game:** Execute the main Python script (`ww1_shooter_game.py`).

2. **Main Menu:** Press **SPACE** to start the game from the main menu.

3. **Movement:** Use **WASD** keys to move your soldier.

4. **Aiming & Shooting:** Move the **mouse** to aim your rifle. Left-click the **mouse** to shoot.

5. **Objective:** Get across No Man's Land and reach the enemy flag at the top of the screen to complete the level.

6. **Health & Lives:** You have 10 health and 3 lives. Avoid enemy fire! If you lose all health, you lose a life and respawn. Losing all lives results in Game Over.

7. **Restart/Next Level:** After a Game Over or completing a level, press **R** to restart the current level or advance to the next.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_name>

   ```

   (Replace `<repository_url>` and `<repository_name>` with your GitHub repository details).

2. **Install Pygame:** This game requires the Pygame library. You can install it using pip:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   ```

   (Ensure you have a `requirements.txt` file with `pygame` listed).

3. **Add Assets:** Create `images` and `sounds` directories in the same folder as the `ww1_shooter_game.py` file. Place your sprite images and sound files in these respective folders. The code currently looks for:

   * `images/player.png`

   * `images/bullet.png`

   * `images/enemy_basic.png`

   * `images/obstacle_sandbags.png`

   * `images/flag.png`

   * `images/tile_grass.png`

   * `images/tile_trench.png`

   * `images/tile_crater.png`

   * `sounds/shoot.wav`

   * `sounds/hit.wav`

   * `sounds/death.wav`

   * `sounds/background_music.ogg`

4. **Run the game:**

   ```
   python ww1_shooter_game.py

   ```

## Future Improvements

* Implement a full A\* pathfinding algorithm for more intelligent enemy movement.

* Develop a robust enemy cover system.

* Add more diverse enemy types with unique behaviors and weapons.

* Design more complex and challenging levels.

* Implement player animations (walking, shooting, dying).

* Add more visual effects (muzzle flashes, explosions, particles).

* Create a scoring system.

* Implement a scrolling camera if levels become larger than the screen.
